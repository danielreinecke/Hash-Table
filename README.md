Hash Table
This program uses a Hash Table to store data about countries that are given in a file
as well as all the user to find, add, and delete countries

It also allows the table to be printed with the collied cells being shown as well as all
of the empty cells in the table. It is also able to print out the number of collied and
empty cells inside of the table

The program will not fail on incorrect input and instead will tell you "invalid input" then
prompt the user for new input.
